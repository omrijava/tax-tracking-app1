## How It Works

### Currency Logic
- **GBP Income/Expenses**: Automatically appear on both US and UK tax forms
- **USD Income/Expenses**: Only appear on US tax forms
- **US Tax Requirement**: Must report worldwide income (including UK earnings)
- **UK Tax Requirement**: Only report UK-sourced income

### Data Storage
All your tax data is stored locally in your computer's application data folder:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Tax Tracker Pro`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Tax Tracker Pro`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Tax Tracker Pro`

### Export Options
Export your data as CSV files that can be:
- Imported into Google Sheets or Excel
- Sent directly to your accountant
- Used with tax preparation software

## Tax Year Support

- **US Tax Years**: Calendar year (Jan 1 - Dec 31)
- **UK Tax Years**: April 6 - April 5 of following year
- **Automatic Detection**: Current tax year is automatically selected
- **Historical Data**: Track up to 5 years of tax data

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ No internet connection required after installation
- ✅ All data encrypted and stored locally
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ Open source - you can verify the code
